# Music Library

## Introduction

A command line interface to interact with your music library.

## Directory and File Structure

The user is prompted as to where the Playlist and Library directories are
located. Within the Library directory, there should be a file called
*library.txt* which contains a list of songs that should be in the library.
Furthermore, the songs must be named in the following format:

```
<artist> - <song name>.mp3
```

Note: This does not put this script in your *PATH*.
